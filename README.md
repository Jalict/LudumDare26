Very first Ludum Dare Submission - Theme Minimalism

##Gameplay
<i>Idea was to make a simple mechanic, and one of the joke themes for this year was potatoes.</i>

You're in a factory of some sort, and your job is to peel potatoes.
Potatoes will come in from left, and then you peel them with your mouse as you click and hover over them.

Your score will then get higher according to how well you peel the potatoes.

If your score goes under -200 your game will end.
Then you can see your highest score though the game and your time.
